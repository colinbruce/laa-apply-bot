# You should store values in a .env file that will over-write these 
# at run time they should be in the format:
# SETTINGS followed by a double underscore and then the name below uppercased
# e.g. SETTINGS__GITHUB_API_TOKEN
github_api_token: 'fake_github_api_token'
github_owner: 'moj'
github_repo: 'project'
github_wait_seconds: 0
# also, please note that, as only sinatra can load these files, you will need to 
# store two copies of the slack_api_token both with and without the prefix
# e.g.
#Â SLACK_API_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
# SETTINGS__SLACK_API_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
# this is hopefully a temporary measure!
